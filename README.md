# chess

This is my programming project.  
Step 1: program the functionalities of a chess game  
Step 2: implement the GUI for the chess game using wxWidgets: [Guide for Ubuntu](https://www.binarytides.com/install-wxwidgets-ubuntu/), [Main Page](https://www.wxwidgets.org/)  
Step 3: provide ways to customly create chess-like board games <- CURRENT  

Note: At its current stage, the program does not have a main product file. 

To test current work:  
cd test/elements  
make  
./run

To play chess using the CLI:  
cd src/elements  
make  
./rungame

To play chess using the GUI (requires wxWidgets):  
cd src/gui  
make  
./run
